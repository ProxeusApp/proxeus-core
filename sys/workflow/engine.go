/**
In this package there are a few words about internal, background and foreground nodes. The meaning of them is here explained.
background node:
	A background node is not blocking the process.
	When you call Next, you get a background node with Current if it is a node at the end of the workflow otherwise you will get a foreground node if no error occurred.
	In the background nodes implementation there should be always returned < proceed > true if no error occurred otherwise it is configured wrong.
	Which means Execute is called once if no error occurred.
	Background nodes can be skipped in the Previous call to be able to get back to the last foreground node if no error occurs.
	Please note, there is no detection for wrong configuration of background nodes during runtime.
	If your node implementation changes and has an effect on the execution type, you must keep the background flag consistent.
foreground node:
	A foreground node is blocking the process.
	When you call Next usually you should get the foreground node by calling Current. Foreground nodes have states in the node implementation that causes Execute to be called more than once.
	For example a form node. It has at least two states. State one is presenting the form, state two or higher is validating the form.
internal node:
	Currently there are just two internal nodes, which is workflow and condition.
	These nodes are handled by the engine itself, they are visible in the Stack but they can also be visible in Current.
	For example if the root workflow starts with another workflow or a condition.
