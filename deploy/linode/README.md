Proxeus StackScript for fast Linode deployment
---

[Linode](https://linode.com) is an American privately-owned cloud hosting company that provides virtual private servers.

StackScripts are private or public managed scripts which run within a Linode instance during startup. Using a simple form you can configure the basic details needed to quickly get a Proxeus instance up and running.

You can find the latest release of this script in the Linode library https://cloud.linode.com/stackscripts/758453

The basic set-up of a Debian or Ubuntu server is based roughly on Linode's [Basic OCA Helper One-Click](https://cloud.linode.com/stackscripts/401712).

We suggest [Securing Public Shadowsocks Server](https://github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks/wiki/Securing-Public-Shadowsocks-Server) as one example guide to follow for further 'buttoning down' your instance.
