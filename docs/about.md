# The Proxeus Association

The association is the governing body responsible for the maintenance and development of the Proxeus software. We also aim to encourage innovation and evangelize the project by launching and supporting community initiatives as well as creating synergies and partnerships with relevant community projects. The Association is working to give the project a decentralized structure (DAO) to allow our members to propose guidance on the software. We want to make the Proxeus software the WordPress of the blockchain and democratize the development of blockchain applications.

Please visit our [Community Forum](https://github.com/ProxeusApp/community/discussions) if you have any questions about the project, or write to us at association@proxeus.org
