## Risk of cryptographic systems

By interacting with the Software in any way, you represent that you understand the inherent risks
associated with cryptographic systems; and warrant that you have an understanding of the usage and
intricacies of native cryptographic tokens, like Ether (ETH), smart contract based tokens such as those
that follow the Ethereum Token Standard, and blockchain based software systems.
You acknowledge and understand that cryptography is a progressing field. Advances in code cracking or
technical advances such as the development of quantum computers may present risks to
cryptocurrencies, which could result in the theft or loss of your cryptographic tokens or property. Proxeus
relies fully on state-of-the-art third party cryptographic solutions and does not guarantee or otherwise
represent full security of the system. By every use of the Software you acknowledge your awareness of
these inherent risks.

## Volatility of crypto currencies

You understand that Ethereum and other DLTâ€™s and associated currencies or tokens such as XES are
highly volatile due to many factors including but not limited to technology, speculation and security risks.
You also acknowledge that the cost of transacting on such technologies is variable and may increase at
any time causing impact to any activities taking place on the DLT. You acknowledge these risks and agree
that Proxeus shall not be liable for such fluctuations or increased costs.

## Application security

You acknowledge that such applications are code, subject to flaws and acknowledge that you are solely
responsible for evaluating any code and the trustworthiness of any third-party websites, products,
smart-contracts, or content you access or use through the Software. You further expressly acknowledge
and represent that such applications can be written maliciously or negligently, that Proxeus shall not be
liable for your interaction with such applications and that such applications may cause the loss of
property or even identity. This warning is like others provided by Proxeus later in no way evidence or
