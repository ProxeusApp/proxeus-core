## Contributing

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Proxeus. It's people like you that make Proxeus such a great tool :)

Following these guidelines indicates that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you complete your pull requests.
Proxeus is an open source project and we love to receive contributions from our community — you! There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, reporting bugs, requesting features, or writing code which can be incorporated into Proxeus itself.

### Ground Rules
* Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds. See our [Code of Conduct (Contributor Covenant)](code_of_conduct.md).
* Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
* Each pull request should implement ONE feature or bugfix. If you want to add or fix more than one thing, submit more than one pull request.
* Do not commit changes to files that are irrelevant to your feature or bugfix (eg: .gitignore).
* Take care that code in pull requests meets our coding guidelines. Be willing to accept criticism and work on improving your code; care must be taken not to introduce bugs. 
* Git commits are much more valued when they follow the git commit messages guide.
* Be aware that the pull request review process is not immediate, and is generally proportional to the size of the pull request.
* If your pull request is merged, please do not ask for an immediate release of a new version. There are many factors contributing to when releases occur. If necessary, please install from the GitLab source until the next official release.

### Getting started
This describes the git workflow that should be used when contributing. It assumes a basic understanding of git (commits, branches, etc.)
1. Work on your own fork of the code rather than on a cloned repository. In order to fork a Github project go to https://github.com/ProxeusApp/proxeus-core, click on "Fork" and choose a suitable GitHub account for the fork —eg. your personal Github account. You only need to fork once per repository.
2. Announce you are on an issue. If you are trying to solve a reported issue, comment that you intend to solve it, and possibly discuss with the community and maintainers the best approach before starting to code.
3. Create a new branch in your fork (be sure it is synchronized with the original project repository!) and name it after the issue from step #2. Code on that branch and commit your changes (it’s always good to add/fix tests).
4. Open a pull request after having pushed your changes. Please, be sure to follow this git commit messages guide.
5. Iterate your changes as the community reviewers or project maintainers comment your code. Your pull request should be accepted as you converge to an accepted solution.
