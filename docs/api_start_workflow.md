# Start Workflow using the API

**Note**: Call to the API must be [authenticated](api_auth.md).

It is possible to start a workflow programmatically using the API.  This is a 
three step process:

1. [List All Workflows](api_list_all_workflows.md): List all workflow available to the authenticated user.
2. [Get Workflow Schema](api_get_workflow_schema.md): Get the workflow schema describing the 
    available fields and their validation rules.
3. [Execute Workflow](api_execute_workflow.md): Execute a workflow by providing all the required field 
    defined in the schema.
