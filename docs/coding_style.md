# Coding style

Thank you for considering to help out with the source code! We welcome contributions from anyone on the internet, and are grateful for even the smallest of fixes!
Code quality assurance does not come for free, it introduces a potentially severe overhead when developing new features and delivering early products. However, this extra effort can be seen as keeping a project fit and healthy. It will in all likelihood save maintenance costs in the future, all the while giving Proxeus a good tech reputation. Once projects are open sourced, high-quality code will motivate internal and external developers to contribute.
In order to get an acceptable code quality standard, we need some fundamental rules in our workflow that we all agree on. Some of these should be followed ASAP, some others can wait for fresh new projects.
